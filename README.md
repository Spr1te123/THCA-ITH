The core objective was to develop and rigorously validate a multimodal imaging phenotype that can accurately identify the risk of DM in DTC before surgery, which is known as the clinical-radiomics-intra-tumor ecological diversity (iTED) (CRIT) phenotype. Furthermore, this study investigated the biological mechanisms underlying the proposed CRIT phenotype by integrating digital pathology analysis with the expression profile of DTC DM biomarkers identified through prior proteomics studies, thereby providing an objective biological basis for imaging-based prediction.
